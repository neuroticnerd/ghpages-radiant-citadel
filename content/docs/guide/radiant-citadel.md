## The Radiant Citadel

Against the unending mist and unseen terrors of the Ethereal Plane, the Radiant Citadel stands bright as a bastion of hope. It’s an ancient relic of long-forgotten technology and the ingenuity and collaboration of twenty-four great civilizations. Abandoned and lost for many generations, the Citadel was resurrected from its slumber and reclaimed by some of the descendants of those societies roughly 250 years ago, though some of the founding civilizations still remain missing and have not been heard from. The Citadel is known for its collaborative society and ecological beauty. Local traditions of oral storytelling have preserved ancestral wisdom from many worlds.

While the city also serves as a nexus of diplomacy and trade, it's true miracle is the vast repository of histories and secrets - information carried down through generations and collected and brought to the Radiant Citadel by its explorers. The wealth of ancient histories of its peoples and those they have encountered would take many lifetimes to study.

The heart of the Radiant Citadel is the enormous Auroral Diamond - a colossal gemstone made of an unknown and indestructible material with no known origin. As enigmatic as it is beautiful, the Auroral Diamond also shines brilliantly, bathing the city and surrounding area in nourishing light - like the sun of the Prime Material Plane. Refracted light glitters across the Auroral Diamond itself, making it impossible to see through, and almost equally difficult to say what color it is - though the proportions of colors vary wildly over time and there exists a whole field of study dedicated to unraveling the mysteries and meanings of the color variations. Some scholars believe each color represents the birth of a new civilization somewhere in the multiverse, and repetition of a color means the death of that civilization. Other scholars hypothesize the changing colors are a countdown to some unknown event.

The city itself is a miracle of architecture and magical technologies, carved into the long-dead fossil which wraps itself around the Auroral Diamond. From what, or from where the the fossil came from is the matter of heated debate among academics, casual conversation among friends, and the subject of fantasies of those which indulge their wildest theories - but no one disputes the truly astonishing scale of the being it must have come from.

The diamond itself seems as if it has moods, changing color ratios unpredictably, but it is always a visible beacon to wanderers lost and in need. The Radiant Citadel is a thriving sanctuary for those seeking safety or a better life. Heroes and paupers meet on equal footing in the Radiant Citadel. By common agreement, power and resources are equitably shared. Dignity is afforded to all, and great need is met with great aid. The Auroral Diamond has profound healing powers and translocation capabilities, even allowing for extraplanar travel, its life-giving magic runs through the entire city and the vegetation, water, light, and unique artifices depend on it.

Life on the Citadel is not entirely a utopia without concern. Just beyond where the light of the Auroral Diamond ends rages a massive, primordial tempest known as the Keening Gloom - an ever-present threat that’s a grim reminder of the Citadel’s precarious position. Nothing that enters the storm has ever been seen again. When explorers rediscovered the Citadel, the Keening Gloom hungrily circled the city. Its endless howl struck terror in their hearts and engulfed several adventurers. After the heroes entered the Citadel and reawakened its power, the storm was driven back. But in times of turmoil within the Citadel, the storm ominously draws closer than usual. Scholars have studied the Keening Gloom for decades but have only theories about its nature, its connection to the Radiant Citadel, and what befalls those caught in its terrible throes. Many fear the storm cannot be held at bay forever.

The Radiant Citadel is overseen by the Speakers of the Ancestors, each member of which represented one of the Citadel's member-civilizations. They hold court in an amphitheater located in the Preserve of the Ancestors. Each speaker holds their position for a decade and represents their civilization on the Citadel. The majority of the Radiant Citadel’s populace comes from the civilizations that govern the city. This makes the population an ethnically diverse mix of humans, dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, along with a variety of other races. Common is widely known, along with dozens of other languages.

## Citadel Defenses

The Radiant Citadel’s location within the Deep Ethereal makes it inherently difficult to assault. It keeps no standing army, but its council for defense has contingency plans it frequently refines based on intelligence from the Court of Whispers.

Among other defenses, the city attracts an unusually large number of powerful adventurers and spellcasters. If the Citadel is attacked, no fewer than a dozen archmages and twenty mages led by Sholeh rally. If required, Aryaat, commander of the Shieldbearers, also mobilizes his Shieldbearer veterans, while the other Speakers for the Ancestors call on the citizenry to bolster the city’s defense.

The Auroral Diamond’s illumination also provides strong protection. It radiates bright light throughout the city and dim light even further, beyond the city’s borders. This light is akin to sunlight, which many natives of the Ethereal Plane and evil Undead abhor.

## PRISM

**WIP:**
- the prism system is how transportation to and from the city works, as well as to some extent within the city
- it draws inspiration from both star trek in it's "transporter" purpose and the flashy rainbow colors of Asgard's Bifrost
- also needed to stay authentic to the setting so the idea of prisms splitting and merging light made perfect sense with the auroral diamond while capturing the bifrost flair
- the prisms and lenses are visible in the mechanisms of the gateroom in particular
- the main "gateroom" is a large circular chamber with a dome-shaped hemispherical roof
- the entirety of the walls and ceiling minus doors are covered in mechanisms that move many circular magical lenses of a wide variety of sizes into appropriate places for what is being transported
- this creates various "focal points" within the chamber when it activates that are where the creatures or goods will materialize
- activation causes torrents of rainbow energy to crackle out of all of the lenses onto the focal points materializing or sending whatever is being transported


## Locations

### Court of Whispers

{{% figure alt="court of whispers hall" src="/images/cow-hall.png" %}}

The Court of Whispers is the market for knowledge, secrets, and information. Skilled scouts and spies can also be hired for short-term reconnaissance or long-term infiltration. The Speakers for the Ancestors - the leaders of the Radiant Citadel - employ freelancers from the Court of Whispers to keep track of major concerns in their people’s homelands, as well as potential threats to the Citadel; the Shieldbearers of the Citadel need information so they can identify crisis points where their operatives are needed. Even common citizens might hire operatives from the Court to find missing loved ones, locate lost family treasures, or gather information on rivals.

The Court is a mixed outdoor-indoor space with quiet alcoves and open plazas, and plentiful work is available here for talented adventurers. Shaded alcoves with seating are soundproofed with Silence to provide private areas for conversation.

Powerful organizations and individuals from across the planes send agents to the Court of Whispers to collect information and do business on their behalf. Noteworthy examples include the Harpers of Abeir-Toril, representatives of Sigil, and agents of the planes-traveling gnome fixer Vi.

### House of Convalescense

{{% figure alt="meditation room" src="/images/hoc-meditation-room.png" %}}

The House of Convalescence sits at a focal point - a sort of leyline to the life-giving energies of the Auroral Diamond, allowing for incredible feats of healing magic. This makes the House of Convalescence an oasis for the sick, the injured, and the desperate. It also draws clerics and healers of many traditions; most come to serve those in need, but some seek to understand the magical properties of the place itself or expand their medical knowledge.

{{% figure alt="house of convalescense foyer" src="/images/hoc-foyer.png" %}}

While within the House of Convalescense, the spells Raise Dead, Resurrection, Revivify, or True Resurrection can be cast without material components. When creatures would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, they instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, a spellcaster restores 12.

### Palace of Exile

{{% figure alt="gardens" src="/images/poe-gardens.png" %}}

Members of the founding civilizations fleeing conflict or disaster after the rediscovery and reoccupation of the Radiant Citadel established the Palace of Exile to provide solace for others as the city had done for them. The palace was named in honor of Socorro the Exile, its founding leader. He was a refugee of war in the land of San Citlán, and he selected the most beautiful complex in the Citadel to house the needy as they arrived. He swore that while his homeland was occupied, he would be an exile and would make his home in the Palace, alongside any others with nowhere else to go.

The Palace of Exile has spacious living quarters which can accomodate many travelers and refugees at once, though in times of great or multiple crisis resources run low. There are beautiful adjoining courtyards and fountains, as well as multiple gardens and a greenhouse. The Palace of Exile also handles outpatient care for the House of Convalescence, caring for the physical, mental, and emotional health of patients as they make the transition to permanent residence or relocating to a new land. The Palace’s staff coordinate closely with the House of Convalescence to provide the best possible aid to the sick and wounded.

### Preserve of the Ancestors

{{% figure alt="druid-sanctuary" src="/images/pota-druid-sanctuary.png" %}}

The Preserve of the Ancestors is a sprawling, domed wilderness cut into the heart of the Auroral Diamond. Lush vegetation grows directly out of the diamond, and the expanse is dotted with various trees, whistling thorn, and zebrawood, plus a number of shrubs and hedges. Insects, small birds, rodents, and the occasional hare make their home here. In the center of the Preserve is a circular, in-ground grassy amphitheater that serves as the meeting place of the Citadel’s ruling council, the Speakers for the Ancestors.

While the Preserve has little indigenous wildlife — mostly birds and small mammals — a sect of druids frequently brings injured animals here to be healed and rehabilitated. The Preserve is also where the druids keep animals that can no longer survive in their native habitats, creating a menagerie of rare creatures from across many worlds.

Drawn by the power of the Auroral Diamond, spirits from countless lands make their home in the Preserve. Spirits from the same lands or of similar origins inhabit tiny jewels and assemble into amalgamations known as Incarnates. Most are small collections of spirits, but the Dawn Incarnates of the founding civilizations are larger-than-life beings that embody the wisdom of ages.

### Trade Distal

{{% figure alt="night market" src="/images/td-colorful-market.png" %}}

The largest open area on the Radiant Citadel is the Trade Discal - a massive marketplace designed so that the founding civilizations could trade on equitable terms. It serves the needs of cities, nations, and major trading companies, rather than individual sellers or producers, which is enforced by its high taxes and fees. Large quantities of goods, such as entire herds of animals or tons of metal ore, can be transported to and from the Trade Discal quickly and safely by the PRISM system.

The Trade Discal is a vital outlet; if something were to happen to it, the impact would be severe for both the Radiant Citadel and the civilizations that depend on it. Adventurers are sometimes hired to oversee the transport of commodities to and from the Citadel or to negotiate on behalf of a major trading company or government. Normally this is a smooth process, but when large amounts of gold are involved, trade is never risk free.

### The Vault

(image TBD - see {{% figure alt="The Archivist" src="guide/radiant-citadel.md#The%20Archivist" %}} for representation of innermost vault chamber)

**WIP:**
- it is part of the massive repository of history contained in the city
- The Vault is a portion of that archive hidden deep within the city
- it houses the secrets, artifacts, relics of great value or significance to the founding cultures that are too dangerous or otherwise valuable to keep in less secure areas

### Satan's Anus

{{% figure alt="Satan's Anus" src="/images/satans-anus.png" %}}

**WIP:**
- popular and rowdy tavern in the lower district
- frequented by those looking for good times, good drinks, and plenty of music and dancing
- Sholeh herself is known to stop in for drinks and dancing
- this is where the PCs will all meet each other
- owned and operated by Johnny Sins
- located near the lower extent of the fossil (hence the name origin)


## Life on the Citadel

The Radiant Citadel is a city of immigrants. Several of the explorers who reclaimed the Citadel were refugees who escaped hardships that plagued their lands. They chose the Citadel as their home, despite its strangeness and the surreal surroundings of the Deep Ethereal, as it presented an opportunity to start anew. Most of the city’s current inhabitants are descendants of the founding civilizations active in the Citadel, but all are welcome.

Some find living in the Deep Ethereal too disquieting with the vast void beyond the city. Others find the finite space of the city too constricting, and still more leave from the anxiety of believing that the Keening Gloom could simply swallow the city at any moment. But their numbers are constantly replenished by the steady stream of arrivals seeking a different life, a new start, the city's lore and wisdom, or solace in the city's peace and safety - and the Citadel's society is shaped by this perpetual ebb and flow of people. Traditions, customs, and values are a mix of old and new; while some adhere to rituals no longer followed in their homeland, others create their own novel practices.

### Art and Culture

The many varied and vibrant communities of the Radiant Citadel constantly learn and borrow from one another - creating a culture wholly unique to the city. This evolution is displayed in the art, the clothing, the music, and - perhaps mostly vividly - in the food of the city. While cantinas, tea houses, and eateries serve food and drink from specific communities, the most popular cuisines are fusion dishes like couscous infused with habanero and saffron, panela-coated fried yams, and kimchi tacos.

### Diplomacy

Relationships between the Radiant Citadel and the founding civilizations are often shifting. The Citadel sends diplomats abroad and houses embassies from foreign governments, but this goodwill is not always reciprocated. The Citadel’s uniqueness makes it a target of foreign actors who seek to exert subtle or overt control over it. At the same time, political activists, dissidents, and revolutionaries seek to exploit the city’s neutrality to their advantage, even staging incursions against their home governments from the relative safety of the Citadel.

### Governance and Politics

The Radiant Citadel is governed by a council known as the Speakers for the Ancestors. Each Speaker is a descendant of one of the founding civilizations currently known to the Citadel. They are chosen by their community and affirmed into office by the wise and ancient Dawn Incarnates. The Speakers for the Ancestors meet openly in the amphitheater in the center of the Preserve, and Citadel residents often watch their debates. All laws and major decisions of the city are decided by majority vote of the Speakers. Debates can become heated because each Speaker represents very different constituents; consensus and compromises might take days or even months to reach. Those citizens of mixed ancestry or unconnected to the founding civilizations can choose a Speaker for the Ancestors to represent them. They register with the Speaker’s office, and from then on, participate in future elections for that Speaker.

Governance is public, transparent, and participatory. Laws are not static but evolve to meet new challenges and needs. Subcouncils and committees manage the city under the guidance of the Speakers. Complexities persist in governing a highly diverse city with varied customs, beliefs, and social norms, but robust civic engagement helps the city overcome adversity.

### Law Enforcement and Justice

Public safety and peacekeeping are administered through a variety of councils and organizations designed to address specific issues. The House of Convalescence helps those living with mental illness, while inspectors investigate nonviolent crimes and use nonlethal methods of detainment. Theft is uncommon in the city, and rehabilitation and restorative justice are preferred methods of addressing wrongs. Highly trained local guards mobilize to handle the rare incidents of violence, and citizens are expected to proactively intervene if needed. The worst offenders are sentenced to a controversial Djaynaian punishment wherein the criminal is subjected to a ritual that prevents them from repeating their crime and then is banished from the city.

### Lifestyle and Society

{{% figure alt="pathway" src="/images/tunnel-pathway.png" %}}

Denizens of the Radiant Citadel strive to sustain their egalitarian society. Every citizen is entitled to a basic income that affords them the necessities of living and dignity in lifestyle. Food, water, and green spaces are equally accessible throughout the city. The House of Convalescence turns no one away; healing is priced according to one’s means, and the poorest are served without charge. All housing is public, distributed, and administered through the city’s councils.

Since the city’s resources are limited due to the Citadel’s relatively small area and its strange nature, foodstuffs and other materials are carefully conserved, and goods are reused, recycled, or repurposed wherever possible. Similarly, most food is vegetarian and is grown in the naturally green spaces throughout the city. Animal products are subject to high tariffs - and thus high prices - because they must be imported.

### Tariffs and Taxation

Taxes are progressive to help reduce the gap between the most affluent and the poorest. High tariffs on imports keep the public coffers full, but the Speakers lower or remove tariffs for civilizations in trouble. Similarly, visitors to the Radiant Citadel must pay a toll to enter. Those who come with nothing except good will pay no fee. Those with big pockets and big hearts give more according to their conscience rather than risk the rebuke of the city’s guards. Rich and poor alike can instead offer something unique that might be to the liking of the Incarnates, such as a lost song, a secret tale, or a rare piece of art. Those who choose this option may present their gift to the Dawn Incarnate of their choice. If their toll is accepted, the visitor is allowed to stay in the Citadel.


## Citadel Factions

### Incarnates

The keepers of vast wisdom from distant lands, the Incarnates are collections of spirits bound within gemstones. Each of an Incarnate’s component gemstones holds a spirit from the same land on the Material Plane. These might be nature spirits from a particular place or the spirits of individuals who once dwelled there. Upon forming, an Incarnate manifests a unique personality and identity, a gestalt of its constituents and their shared background. The greater the number of spirits that make up an Incarnate, the broader and deeper both its personality and its knowledge are.

Most Incarnates are small, no more than a handful of gems in the shape of a plant or animal. The least of them originate from spirits lost on the Ethereal Plane and are tiny collections of wayward spirits of similar origins with nowhere else to go. The largest and most influential are those of the fifteen founding civilizations collectively known as the Dawn Incarnates. Spanning more than a dozen feet in height, these Incarnates are composed of thousands of smaller gems of the same type. Each holds court in a portion of the Preserve, such as the Amethyst Tiger’s knoll or the Obsidian Eagle’s aerie.

The Dawn Incarnates have existed since the creation of the Radiant Citadel. While the Citadel’s creators left behind no texts, it’s believed that their collective wisdom is held by the Dawn Incarnates. The Dawn Incarnates know everything that transpires in the Preserve of the Ancestors, which is why they require the Speakers for the Ancestors to meet there. While they do not interfere in the day-to-day administration of the city, they hold the Speakers responsible to the duties of their office. While a Dawn Incarnate has never removed a Speaker for the Ancestors, it is believed they could do so if displeased.

#### Identities of the Incarnates

Each Incarnate has a unique, amalgamated personality. Most who interact with an Incarnate interact with this primary identity. However, an Incarnate’s primary personality is not a repository of its constituent spirits’ knowledge; these spirits have their own thoughts and personalities. While an Incarnate broadly knows what its spirits know, a wealth of information is locked inside them. A constituent spirit within an Incarnate might be awakened by evoking the spirit’s name or presenting something of significance to that spirit. Once a spirit is awakened, it takes over as the dominant personality of the Incarnate for a matter of minutes and might share its specific memories.

A spirit knows only what it has observed. A nature spirit that inhabited a small pond might know a great deal about the fisher who visited its banks every week for fifty years, but might not know that person’s name or where they lived. An ancestor spirit might know the intimate details of their family and town, but nothing about their neighbor’s great-grandchildren. Each spirit is a single window into the civilization; together, an Incarnate’s spirits have a wide but not infallible perspective on the history of their people.

#### Audiences with Incarnates

An Incarnate and its constituent spirits are not malicious or duplicitous, but they do not necessarily answer questions easily or without a price. Some require the completion of a quest, while others might give a puzzle to solve. Some speak plainly; others respond in poem or parable. And some refuse to speak at all.

#### Fate of the Missing

A grim anomaly, a dead Dawn Incarnate known as the Sapphire Wyvern, disturbs the tranquility of the Preserve of the Ancestors. It lies inert, its gemstones blackened and cracked. Scholars believe it was the Dawn Incarnate of one of the Radiant Citadel’s twelve lost civilizations, but all efforts to awaken it have failed. What happened to it and the eleven absent Dawn Incarnates of the other founding civilizations, no one knows.

### Speakers for the Ancestors

The Speakers for the Ancestors are the ruling body of the Radiant Citadel. Candidates are chosen through an election process among the diaspora of people they represent. Once a candidate has been elected, they must face the active Dawn Incarnates and pass their tests. Some Dawn Incarnates question the candidate until they are satisfied, while others send the candidate on a quest. These trials ensure that Speakers understand each of the founding civilizations of the Radiant Citadel.

Once a Speaker for the Ancestors is chosen, they hold office for ten years. At the end of their tenure, they can step down; if they don’t, they must face the same selection process again. There is no assurance a Speaker will be reelected, or if they are, that the Dawn Incarnates will approve them again.

As founding civilizations are rediscovered and rejoin the Radiant Citadel, the council is expanded, and the new Speakers gain power equal to that of their peers.

#### A Speaker’s Role

The Speakers for the Ancestors face incredible challenges in their role. They must maintain the internal stability of a large and diverse city and ensure its people are treated equally and fairly under the law. Simultaneously, they manage a complex relationship with the founding civilizations. The Speakers’ first duty is to the Radiant Citadel, which sometimes puts them at odds with the governments of the founding civilizations, particularly in tariff disputes or major crises. Thus far, the Radiant Citadel’s policy is to resolutely remain neutral in all conflicts—whether they involve the founding civilizations or otherwise. However, the Citadel seeks to rescue refugees and send humanitarian aid to the limits of its resources. While decisions by the Speakers are made by simple majority, each Speaker has a very powerful veto that prevents them from being marginalized by political alliances.

#### Bound to the Citadel

Once a Speaker no longer holds office, they lose the powers related to their position. If a Speaker steps down before the end of their term or dies while in office, all basic necessities in the Radiant Citadel gradually cease to function. Unless a suitable replacement for that Speaker is elected and approved by the Dawn Incarnates within thirty days, plants in the Radiant Citadel stop growing, wells run dry, and lighting ceases to function. Similarly, a Speaker cannot leave the Radiant Citadel for more than thirty days before the city’s basic utilities begin to fail. Speakers for the Ancestors are often celebrated heroes capable of handling most any danger that comes their way, yet they are so vital to the Radiant Citadel that each is carefully protected, both magically and by contingents of guards.

### Shieldbearers

The Shieldbearers are the Radiant Citadel’s dedicated search-and-rescue force, and are headquartered nextdoor to the Palace of Exile. Where there is a need, the Shieldbearers help. Since their founding, the Shieldbearers have also been the vangaurd of the Radiant Citadel’s defensive capabilities, but the majority of their time is spent on search and rescue efforts as well as humanitarian endeavors.

Typically organized in cohorts of four to six members, they are deployed to lands in crisis. Strict rules of engagement prevent them from impacting local conditions or taking sides in a conflict; their mandate allows them only to extract those in danger and defend themselves if attacked. They are among the bravest of the Citadel, and heroes who die in service to the Shieldbearers receive the city’s highest honors.

Shieldbearers stand ready to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the vulnerable and the defenseless. Many members adhere to a tradition of getting a ritual scar or tattoo after each successful deployment, designed to represent a pivotal moment in that quest. The most accomplished veterans display such body art with pride. Many adventurers who come to the Radiant Citadel and decide to stay eventually join the Shieldbearers.


## People

### Speaker Sholeh

{{% figure alt="Sholeh" src="/images/speaker-sholeh.jpeg" width="300" %}}

Sholeh is a legendary figure in the history of the Citadel. Having led the successful effort to rediscover the Radiant Citadel, she was the first Speaker for the Ancestors and is the only originator of that position to still hold the office. For two hundred and fifty years, she has been a consummate councilor and has deftly managed the complex politics of the city. She hopes to find the missing twelve founding civilizations and believes the fate of the Citadel depends on it.

Known affectionately (or derisively) as the Old Lady, she is an older, brown-skinned human woman. Quick to anger and quicker to love, she has rivals and adversaries aplenty, but friends and suitors in even greater number. She loves a good drink, loves dancing even more, and spends her free time with the common citizens of the city. More frequently, she’s legislating in the council or negotiating in a secret corner of the Court of Whispers, trading for information or sending spies on missions.

She has a complex relationship with her homeland. While she loves Akharin Sangar, she refuses to bend to the will of its angelic ruler, Atash. Rather than oppose him directly, she plays a delicate political game even as she worries about the future of her native land.

{{% callout type="warning" title="SECRET: Sholeh's True Form" open=true %}}
{{% figure alt="closest-i-could-find" src="/images/sholeh-dragon-01.png" %}}

There are some long-time residents that remember the time shortly after the rediscovery of the Radiant Citadel but a fair number fewer that are long-lived enough to have actually been there - but the ones that were... they remember. They remember the huge gold scales and their mesmerizing brilliance. The long smooth gold horns, adorned near the base by a wide band of ornately crafted bright red metal, followed by 3 thinner bands. The sheath of leather strapped to the ends, trailing long red and gold chiffon streamers. The elegant swept back features of her head ending in smaller gold spikes. They remember the colossal form of the unfathomably ancient gold dragon Sholeh; the mastermind and leader of the expedition to rediscover and reawaken the Radiant Citadel 250 years ago. Since taking office as Speaker no one has seen her appear as a dragon in public; no one truly knows why that is, but there are as many theories as there are people on the Citadel.

{{% /callout %}}

#### The Goldscales

{{% figure alt="Goldscale Tattoo" src="/images/goldscale-glyph.png" %}}

In times of great need or crisis, or when the Shieldbearers and/or other resources are stretched too thin, Speaker Sholeh prefers to take a more proactive role in solutions and resolutions, but her duties as Speaker greatly limit her ability to be directly involved. To this end, when the need arises Sholeh assembles a group of talented individuals who report directly to her and act as her eyes, ears, and hands to extend her reach and influence both within and beyond the Radiant Citadel: The Goldscales. In return for completing missions when called upon, Goldscales are given permanent residence and enjoy certain privileges and access within the city. Not everyone is an ally of Sholeh, however, and Goldscales tend not to advertise their allegiance unless loyalties are known.

It has been more than 100 years since Speaker Sholeh has asked anyone to become a Goldscale, and many Citadel inhabitants of shorter-lived races either haven't heard of the Goldscales or consider them to be something of myth or exaggeration.

As proof of accepting her offer, Sholeh herself imbues each member with a magical tattoo depicting a gold-scaled infinity symbol, appearing as if it moves with changes to the viewing angle.

### Aryaat

(image TBD)

Now in his forties, he is the commander of the Shieldbearers. He is a masterful tactician and highly competent leader, but he grates against the rules of engagement imposed on the Shieldbearers by the Speakers for the Ancestors. He has cremated at least a hundred fallen comrades and seen horrors few can comprehend. The toll has pushed him to his limits, and he believes a more aggressive, proactive strategy is needed and violence should be employed to save lives; thus far, however, he has not defied the council.
